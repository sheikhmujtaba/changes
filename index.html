   In chapter 7 the author talks about making sense of data through different levels such as mean, mode and other measures of central tendency. Whereas, in chapter 8 he talks about features of a time series line chart that enable us to conclude information from the chart. The first feature is the trend of the chart, is it upward sloped or downward sloped or is it constant. Then he wants us to analyze the seasonality of the variables, whether they have a consistent fluctuation over a specific period of time. Lastly, he talks about the noise in a visualization, by which he means the random changes in the chart which cannot be defined by a specific factor.

  In chapter 7 he talks about taking quartiles and divide our data into different parts to deduce more information about our data and see the trend and outliers. In chapter 8 he talks about adjusted variations and moving averages to deduce meaningful information from our time series line chart.

The three visualization techniques he talks about is the trend, seasonality and noise. These give us information about our data by assisting us in concluding the shifts in our chart and what causes these shifts. But they can be very misleading if the data is not represented properly. As in figure 8.31 a bad time series chart is shown, which has missing information, however it is represented as it has all the information. Therefore, we must make sure our visualizations are a true representation of our actual data.
